    Input(shape=(60, 1)),  # 60-day close price sequences
    
    # Single LSTM layer with strong regularization
    LSTM(15,
         kernel_regularizer=l2(0.003),
         recurrent_regularizer=l2(0.003),
         recurrent_dropout=0.4),
    
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.6),
    Dense(1, kernel_regularizer=l2(0.003))
])
```
